Every holiday season, RP3 Agency does a project that allows clients and friends to choose the allocation of donations to local charities. In 2015, we made a web-friendly `virtual reality` game using `Three.js`, and we created branded Google Cardboards to send to our clients.

I was the `3D Modeler` on this yeti snowball fight game. I created the trees, snow mounds, logs, rocks, and charity signs using `Blender`. Never having used Blender and only having 3D modeled a small handful of objects, it was a fun challenge to develop the skills under a tight deadline.
