excerpt: The Human Resources Certification Institute (HRCI) needed a refresh of their website to reflect their recently simplified enrollment process. I was the lead UX designer on the project, though when we got to the development phase I became the lead front-end developer.

The [Human Resources Certification Institute](http://www.hrci.org) (HRCI) had recently expanded and simplified their certification offerings, and needed a refresh of their website to make finding the right certification and signing up for it equally simple. The scope of the project allowed RP3 Agency to create five new templates for their CMS, and as the `lead UX designer` on the project, it was my responsibility to identify aspects of the site that were in the most need of UX updates. I designed wireframes using `Sketch` and presented them to the client with `InVision`,

Two of the biggest overhauls were the Build Your Own Bundle (BYOB) page (which allowed a user to put together an assortment of preparation materials with their exam application at a discounted rate) and the Preparation Products page (which listed preparation materials for all exams). The original BYOB page listed bundle options for every exam, and did not include information about the preparation materials aside from titles, so a user would have to refer to the Preparations Materials page for detailed information about a particular item. Because each exam is for a different type of HR professional, it was not important for a user to be presented with bundles/preparation materials for all exams. I proposed creating [exam-specific preparation pages](https://www.hrci.org/how-to-get-certified/build-your-own-bundle/aphr-preparation) that include both bundle options and preparation materials, with accordions to provide more information on materials right where the user needs it. This resulted in a drastically simplified experience for the user.

My colleague who was originally set to do the development of these updates was unable to work on the project, so I became the `lead front-end developer`, using tools such as `Sass`, `EJS`, and `bootstrap`
