UCSF Benioff Children's hospital needed to make scheduling an appointment and referring a patient simpler faster than their planned complete redesign could be finished. I worked with designers, product owners, project managers, and QA to lead the development of a `Vue` based `AA compliant` front end. I set up our development environment using `Vue CLI`, `Prettier`, `ESLint`, `stylelint`, `Sass`, and `pre-commit hooks`.

Accessibility was a big requirement, and we worked with QA and design to ensure that the site passed all of the necessary requirements. For example, the designs called for a video in the hero section. We worked with our designers to add a keyboard accessible play/pause button as this is required for background videos that play automatically and last over 5 seconds. For a background video further down the page, we worked with design to get the video under 5 seconds. We also worked with design to pass contrast requirements and we made the site entirely navigable by keyboard.
