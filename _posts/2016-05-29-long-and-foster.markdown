[Long & Foster](http://www.longandfoster.com/), the nation's largest privately owned real estate company, was in need of a major redesign for their site. This was a year-long project that I saw through from strategy and branding to launch. Because we were working as a small team, I had opportunities to do a lot outside of my typical job description, such as a content audit, but my primary role in this project was in building out prototypes.

[RP3 Agency](https://rp3agency.com/) was hired to design the website, while RED, a company that specializes in a real estate based CMS, was hired for the production. My job was to work closely with our team to develop `resonsive HTML prototypes` to clearly represent our intentions for the site at any browser size.

One part of the site that involved a lot of `UX thinking` and `iterative prototyping` was a priority sorting tool (demonstrated above) that buyers and sellers can use to figure out what their needs are and share them with a Long & Foster agent. This helps generate higher quality leads for the client because the agents gain a better sense of the customer's needs than a traditional lead form.
