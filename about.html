		I am a creative technologist currently working at RP3 Agency. I develop platforms that engage people in new forms of interaction and play. My space soccer themed four player arcade game, FÃºtbol Forever, has been widely exhibited at galleries and events such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum, World Maker Faire, MAGFest, and Bushwick Open Studios. I also lead the design and development of an SMS-based public health reporting tool in Guatemala. I love to tinker with emerging technologies and think about applications for them.
