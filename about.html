	<p>
		I am a detail-oriented and flexible engineer dedicated to improving healthcare accessibility and transparency. I
		have worked in all stages of the design and development process which makes me an empathetic collaborator, and I am
		experienced in
		utilizing design thinking to create digital experiences that minimize user effort, using whatever technology best
		suits the product (even if I have to learn it on the fly).
	</p>

	<p>
		I led a team of in the creation of an open-source SMS/web platform empowering rural indigenous Guatemalans to hold
		their government accountable for
		providing healthcare, as part of a fellowship with Open Society Foundations. This project has also been used for
		community reporting of issues that lead to maternal mortality rates in Assam, India.

		Outside of leading front-end development for website redesigns or creating interactive installations for
		experiential clients, I have spent the last six years working with Death By Audio Arcade to build and curate indie
		arcade exhibitions. The DBAA collection, including my game (FÃºtbol Forever), has been widely shown at galleries and
		events including the Smithsonian American Art Museum and World Maker Faire. Partnering with Dreamhouse, an LGBTQ
		venue in Ridgewood Queens, to commission nine games by local queer developers for an arcade cabinet installed on
		site is one of my all time favorite projects I have been a part of.
