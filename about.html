		I am a freelance creative technologist who develops platforms that engage people in new forms of interaction and play. My space soccer themed four player arcade game, FÃºtbol Forever, has been widely exhibited at galleries and events such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum, World Maker Faire, MAGFest, and Bushwick Open Studios. I also lead the design and development of an SMS-based public health reporting tool in Guatemala. I love to tinker with emerging technologies and think about applications for them. I dream of trying every regional fast food chain out there.

	I received my MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design in 2014.
